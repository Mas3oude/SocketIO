Network package are 5 
from down to up
1- Physical --  actual phical cables
2- Link  ---- wifi or eathernet connection
3- Network  -- IP
4- Transport -- UDP or TCP   so network and Transport called ---> TCP/IP
5- Application   --- HTTP or HTTPS , SSH and FTP and SMTP


Transport layer creates 2 to the powe 16 ports in your compueter 65000 ports

UDP 
    -is light weight
    -8 bytes for the header
    -connection less which means when you want to send data .. they don't have to create connection they just start talking
        even if the another computer not replying
    -send data no matter of what 
    - from my experience it is used more for the video calls and when you don't care if there will any missing in the packets
